Coding standard:

NAMING
Name it after how it's used, not what it does, use math analogies where possible


FUNCTION NAMES
Function names should be not be abbrevated, choose "string" over str

return values from functions should be called result

try to keep it short, functions should aim to be no longer than 20 lines of code

replace boolean expressions with function names

functions returning bool should start with the word "is" or "has"

two functions should never do just about the same thing

never use the word get, its implicit, if you want to have a getter-function call
it x() and not get_x()
